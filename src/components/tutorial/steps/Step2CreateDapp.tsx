          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Permission errors</strong> - Try running with <code>sudo</code> on Mac/Linux, or
            run terminal as administrator on Windows

          <li>
            <strong>Network timeout</strong> - Check your internet connection and try again
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Slow installation</strong> - First install is slower as packages are downloaded
            and cached. Subsequent installs will be much faster!
